Dear Public Affairs Team,
I hope this email finds you well.

I am a student of the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw. I am writing to ask for permission to use images from the official Super-Kamiokande website for academic purposes. I intend to incorporate these images into my Bachelor's thesis presentation. The presentation will be seen by students and professors during my exam only. My thesis is on atmospheric neutrino oscillations based on Super-Kamiokande data. My supervisor, Dr. Magdalena Posiadała-Zezula (included in CC) is a member of the Super-Kamiokande collaboration. I will certainly include the copyright notice. Could you please provide some higher resolution images from the website's gallery? Specifically, I would like to ask for the following files: Super-Kamiokande Construction（1993～1996）No. 1 and No. 11 from the photo gallery on the official webiste.
Thank you for considering my request.

Yours sincerely,

Maria Kondzielska
